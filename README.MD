# Bearslist

A single page to list all the tech I am trying to get rid of.

Everything here is **_pay what you can afford_** + shipping as I'm saving up for a move to Sweden. If you're unsure, a good rule of thumb is checking ebay for similar items that have been sold as used.

## Computers

I can piece these out but I would prefer to sell the biggest chunks I can to minimize logistics.
